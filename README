This project has been designed to help students or hobbyists get started with driving stepper motors on the Raspberry PI. It covers two types of stepper motor namely unipolar and bipolar. 

It includes code to either drive either 
  • One or two x 5-Wire "28BYJ-48" stepper Motor (bipolar motor) with ULN2803A driver
Or
  • A 12-volt #324 (Nema17) high torque stepper motor (unipolar motor) with A4988 H-Driver circuit

The software is maintained in the following GitHub repository.
https://github.com/bobrathbone/pistepper

To download the software, go to your home directory and download the software using the git
clone command shown below:

$ cd
$ git clone https://github.com/bobrathbone/pistepper

This will download the development files into the pistepper directory. Change directory to pistepper.
$ cd pistepper

RPi.GPIO
========
These examples have been written using the RPi.GPIO library to manipulate the GPIO pins. 
RPi.GPIO does not work on the Bookworm OS or the Raspberry model 5. To get around this a 
so called software shim called GPIOconverter has been written to convert RPi.GPIO calls to the new 
LGPIO library. If running on a Raspberry Pi model 5 or if running Bookworm or later carry 
out the following instruction:

touch RPi/__init__.py

This will cause all RPi.GPIO calls to be redirected to RPi/GPIO.py. To disable this redirection
carry out the following instruction:

rm  RPi/__init__.py 

For more information on GPIOconverter see https://github.com/bobrathbone/gpioconverter

Alternatively run the software on the legacy Bullseye OS and a Raspberry Pi model 4
which both support RPi.GPIO
